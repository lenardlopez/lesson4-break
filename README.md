Connection:
	It seems that connection in Break is automatically connecting to Devnet unlike in HelloWorld you have to manually input "devnet".

Generating a keypair:
	Looks like it is using secretKey to generate a Keypair.
	
Requesting airdrop:
	Maybe using the Import 'subscribedCommitments' to request for airdrop.
	
Overall:
	Code in HelloWorld is organized in hello_world.ts
